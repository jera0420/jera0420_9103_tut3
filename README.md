I went to the Van Gogh live exhibition, which was such an inspiring experience.
Iâ€™d love to be able to do something like that for this project - to make the image move within its own patterns of stroke.

For example, to make water part of the painting Saint Georges Majeur by Claude Monet move similar to how water does with the force of wind.

### Coding Technique Exploration

Something similar might be achievable by creating a 3D Perlin noise function with a for loop and low speed. This would not be interactive but would create a cool animation and feel of immersion in the spectator.
